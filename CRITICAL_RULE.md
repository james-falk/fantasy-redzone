# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULE - RSS FEED SOURCES

## NEVER ADD OR DELETE RSS FEED SOURCES WITHOUT EXPLICIT USER PERMISSION

### The Problem
- NBA basketball content appeared in a Fantasy Football site
- This happened because non-football YouTube channels were added as sources
- The user explicitly stated: "I told you not to add or delete any sources on your own"

### The Rule
1. **NEVER add new RSS feed sources** without explicit user permission
2. **NEVER delete existing RSS feed sources** without explicit user permission  
3. **NEVER modify feed source configurations** without explicit user permission
4. **ALWAYS ask first** before making any changes to feed sources
5. **ONLY work with sources the user has explicitly approved**

### Current NBA Sources to Remove
- Channel 1 (UC7mnFgvC365vmb6b2EYFcjw)
- Channel 2 (UCv8IHFJEe14ijNK6jh-p0dQ) 
- Channel 3 (UCxdIF1wU7jX-htzVCDmDu8A)

### Approved Fantasy Football Sources Only
- Fantasy Footballers
- FantasyPros  
- CBS Sports Fantasy
- NFL Fantasy
- ESPN NFL News
- CBS Sports NFL
- Draft Sharks
- Dynasty Nerds
- Dynasty League Football

### Action Required
1. Remove NBA basketball sources from database
2. Clear NBA content from existing resources
3. Ensure only fantasy football content is ingested
4. Never add non-football sources again

### Memory Entry
**USER RULE**: I must NEVER add or delete RSS feed sources without explicit user permission. The user has made this a hard requirement after NBA content appeared in their fantasy football site.
