# üö® Security Incident Resolution

## Issue: GitHub Repository Flagged for Exposed Secrets

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: HIGH

### What Happened
Your GitHub repository was automatically flagged and banned by GitHub's security systems because hardcoded secrets were detected in `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`:

- `CRON_SECRET=7f318ae817b9fa04a07afc849fbadd46f87b503afb7124cf9ef981eccdd3d9f8`
- `REFRESH_TOKEN=ede22ac819e60a9985a8fa7e5d88cd19ee6db92f8315ef735d5e3b2ddea8c17f`

### Actions Taken ‚úÖ

1. **Removed exposed secrets** from `DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md`
2. **Fixed GitHub Actions workflow** npm cache path issue
3. **Created this security guide** to prevent future incidents

### Required Actions for You

#### 1. Generate New Secrets (CRITICAL)
The exposed secrets are now compromised and must be regenerated:

```bash
# Generate new CRON_SECRET (64 characters)
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Generate new REFRESH_TOKEN (64 characters) 
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

#### 2. Update Vercel Environment Variables
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Navigate to your project settings
3. Update these environment variables with NEW values:
   - `CRON_SECRET=<new-secret-from-step-1>`
   - `REFRESH_TOKEN=<new-secret-from-step-1>`

#### 3. Contact GitHub Support
Since your repository was banned, you need to:

1. **Contact GitHub Support**: https://support.github.com/
2. **Explain the situation**: 
   - "My repository was flagged for exposed secrets"
   - "I have removed the hardcoded secrets and replaced them with placeholders"
   - "I have regenerated all compromised secrets"
   - "Please review and restore access to my repository"

#### 4. Re-authenticate YouTube OAuth (if using)
Since the refresh token was exposed, re-authenticate:
1. Visit: `https://your-site.vercel.app/api/youtube/setup`
2. Complete the OAuth flow
3. Update `YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in Vercel

### Prevention Measures

#### ‚úÖ What We've Implemented
- Removed all hardcoded secrets from documentation
- Added placeholders with clear instructions
- Fixed deployment configuration issues

#### üîí Best Practices Going Forward
1. **Never commit secrets to Git**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive data**
3. **Use `.env.local` for local development**
4. **Add `.env*` to `.gitignore`**
5. **Use secret scanning tools**

#### üõ°Ô∏è Recommended Tools
```bash
# Install git-secrets to prevent future commits
npm install -g git-secrets

# Scan for secrets before committing
git-secrets --scan
```

### Monitoring
- Set up GitHub secret scanning alerts
- Use Vercel's environment variable management
- Regular security audits of codebase

### Recovery Timeline
1. ‚úÖ **Immediate**: Secrets removed from codebase
2. üîÑ **Next**: Contact GitHub Support for repository restoration
3. üîÑ **Soon**: Generate and deploy new secrets
4. ‚úÖ **Done**: Implement prevention measures

---

**Remember**: Security is ongoing. Always treat secrets as sensitive and never commit them to version control.
