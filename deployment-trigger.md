Deployment timestamp: 2025-01-21T20:45:00.000Z

## CRITICAL FIX:
Fixed the main issue preventing YouTube videos from displaying! The content service was using incorrect URLs for API calls in production. Now uses proper Vercel environment detection.

## Changes Made:
1. Enhanced RSS parser to handle malformed feeds
2. Fixed carousel hydration issues
3. Added /api/debug endpoint for troubleshooting
4. Consistent fallback images to prevent hydration mismatches

## Expected Result:
- YouTube videos should display with thumbnails
- No more RSS parsing errors
- No more React hydration errors
